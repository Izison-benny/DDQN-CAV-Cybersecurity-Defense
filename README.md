# DDQN-CAV-Cybersecurity-Defense

This repository provides a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) based adaptive cybersecurity defense system for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The system dynamically switches between module-language configurations to minimize attack risks and maximize Quality of Service (QoS) under cyber-threat scenarios.
